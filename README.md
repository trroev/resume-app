## How It's Made:

**Built with:**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started:

```
git clone https://github.com/trroev/resume-app.git
cd resume-app
npm install
npm start
```

## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun little project for my first foray in to learning React. Using functional components and React Hooks made the code look much cleaner and easier to read and follow in my opinion. It was a struggle for me to figure out how to properly use props to get the user input to render in the resume preview, but once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.
